### Getting a Gap file
The gap file is a bed file that identifies regions that should be excluded from the analysis. Typical candidates for exclusion are the repeat regions at centromeres and telomeres. Failure to include a proper gap file for an experiment will increase the number of false positives among the detected peaks. An example gap file for hg19 can be found at https://github.com/eivindgl/edd/blob/master/data/gap_hg19.bed
